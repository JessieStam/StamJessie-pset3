Pset 3: To-Do list

Native App Studio

This application allows the user to create a simple to-do list, to which items can be added and from which items can be marked as done
and deleted.

Unfortunately, I could get the application to work with the SQLite Database. For that reason I have chosen to ommit the connection between
the Database Helper and the Main Acitivity altogether. In my opinion it was more important that the application worked partially than to
link the files and submit something that doesn't work at all. I did finish the Database Helper, so I hope you will still take a look at it.
I hope you can give me some feedback, since I find it really hard to link files and to understand how this works. Thanks in advance!
